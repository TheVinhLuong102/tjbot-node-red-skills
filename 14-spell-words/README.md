# Day 14 - Spell Words

Today weâ€™ll train TJBot to spell out the letters of words using the speak node and the Watson Text to Speech service.

## Flow

The flow consists of an inject node with the words to spell out, a template node that wraps the contents with SSML to instruct the Watson Text to Speech service to pronounce the letters individually, and a speak node to play the synthesized audio via the speaker.

## Template Node to Format with SSML

```
{{payload}}
is spelled
<speak>
    <say-as interpret-as="letters">{{payload}}</say-as>
</speak>
```

## Tips

* Don't forget to create a Watson Text to Speech service and use the service credentials in the TJBot configuration

## Extra Credit

* Use other SSML tags to add a variation to spelling words
