# Day 10 - Converse

Today weâ€™ll train TJBot to respond using the converse node and the Watson Conversation service.

## Flow

The flow consists of an inject node to inject a blank payload string, a converse node to process the content via Watson Conversation, and a debug node to output the response to the debug window.

## Tips

* Don't forget to create a Watson Conversation service and use the service credentials in the TJBot configuration

## Extra Credit

* Dive into the `msg.response.output` property and display just the text returned from the Conversation API in the debug window
