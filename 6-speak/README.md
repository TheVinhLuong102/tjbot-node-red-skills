# Day 6 - Speak

Today weâ€™ll train TJBot to speak using the speaker and the Watson Text to Speech service.

## Flow

The flow consists of an inject node with the phrase TJBot should speak and a speak node that synthesizes the phrase into an audio file played via the speaker using the Watson Text to Speech service.

## Tips

* Audio not playing? Check the Speaker Device ID to make sure the right audio card and device are used.

## Extra Credit

* Choose another language for TJBot to speak and change the inject node to a greeting in that language
