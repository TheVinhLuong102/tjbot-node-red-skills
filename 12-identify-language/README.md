# Day 12 - Identify Language

Today weâ€™ll train TJBot to identify what language a phrase is using the Watson Language Translator Service.

## Flow

The flow consists of an inject node with a greeting, a translate node with the mode Identify Language, and a debug node to display the results from the Watson Language Translator service.

## Tips

* Don't forget to create a Watson Language Translator service and use the service credentials in the TJBot configuration

## Extra Credit

* Write a JavaScript function to extract out the two letter language code for the highest scoring language identified
