# Day 4 - Listen

Today weâ€™ll train TJBot to listen using the microphone and the Watson Speech to Text service.

## Flow

The flow consists of two inject nodes to start and stop listening, a change node to set the mode, a listen node to capture audio and transcribe into text, and a debug node to display the utterances in the debug window.

```

## Tips

* The change node sets the `msg.mode` using the payload value from the inject node.

## Extra Credit

* Choose another language for TJBot to listen and transcribe into text
* Stop listening after a specified duration of time
* Stop listening after the first utterance is spoken
