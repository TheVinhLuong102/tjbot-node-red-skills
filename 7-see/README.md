# Day 7 - See

Today weâ€™ll train TJBot to see using the Raspberry Pi camera and the Watson Visual Recognition service.

## Flow

The flow consists of an inject node to trigger the flow, a see node that takes a picture and classifies objects and colors using the Watson Visual Recognition service, and a debug node to output the results to the debug window.

## Tips

* Camera not enabled? Open the Raspberry Pi Configuration and tick the the radio button to enable the camera. Reboot the Raspberry Pi.

## Extra Credit

* Filter just the names of objects or just the names of colors
* Use the score value to omit to omit low scoring classes
