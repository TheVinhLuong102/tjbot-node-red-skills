# Day 1 - Setup TJBot and Node-RED

Today we'll learn how to flash the Raspbian Jessie with Desktop image to a microSD card; enable SSH, VNC, and the Camera interfaces, set an SSH password, and upgrade Node.js and Node-RED to the latest version; install a Node-RED package containing nodes that can be used with the TJBot; and create a profile for TJBot to use as we train it with different abilities to perform. There are four videos:

### Flash MicroSD card
