# Day 18 - Analyze Language Tones

Today weâ€™ll train TJBot how to analyze language tones using the analyze tone node and the Watson Tone Analyzer service.

## Flow

The flow consists of an inject node to run the flow, an analyze tone node to get the language tones using the Watson Tone Analyzer service, and a debug node to output the results to the debug window.

## Tips

* Don't forget to create a Watson Tone Analyzer service and use the service credentials in the TJBot configuration

## Extra Credit

* Connect a listen node to analyze language tones in speech input
* Connect a function and speak node to output a human-friendly result.
	
## Resources

Refer to the [Watson Tone Analyzer documentation](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/tone-analyzer/using-tone.html#tones) to understand what the three language tones represent.
